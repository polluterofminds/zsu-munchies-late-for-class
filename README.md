# Zombie State University - Munchie's Late For Class
### A JS13k Game Submission

This is a submission to the 2022 JS13k game jam. The theme this year was "Death" which fit in nicely with an NFT project [Josh Stifter](https://www.joshstifter.com/) and I (polluterofminds) worked on last year. The project is called [Zombie State University](https://zombiestateuniversity.com). Outside of the NFT aspects, it was such a fun conceptâ€”zombies had won the war against humans and had to find a way to live a normal life in peace, starting with the creation of their first university. 

It was a natural fit to build a game around this world for the JS13k competition. 

**Game Concept**  
In the game, you play as Munchie, a first cohort student at ZSU. You don't want to be late for your first class, so you have to navigate the campus carefully while watching the time on your wrist watch tick closer and closer to the class's start time. 

The game is a 2D platformer in the style of old school Nintendo games. You can avoid obstacles, hit certain obstacles with your bat, or you can move obstacles by being helpful. There are many ways to play the game, so we hope that replayability is high.
